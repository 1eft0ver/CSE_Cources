Taiwanese people believe that ghosts leave the underworld for one month every year. To ensure that these ghosts are happy and do not bother them, Taiwanese people observe certain traditions during ¡§Ghost Month.¡¨ This festival takes place in July on the lunar calendar. Ghost Month is a time when families pray for the ghosts of their ancestors. They will also leave food out to feed any ¡§hungry ghosts¡¨ that might wander by.

Taiwanese people will also burn specially printed ghost money to make sure that their ancestors are comfortable in the afterlife. All in all, Ghost Month is seen as an unlucky time of year. Because of this, very few people get married, move into a new house, or open a business during this month. Going near water is also forbidden, because the wandering ghosts may drag you under to replace them, so that they can have another chance at life.
